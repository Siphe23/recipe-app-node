# Recipe App

This is a **Recipe App** built with **React.js** that allows users to create, update, and manage their favorite recipes. The app utilizes a `db.json` file for data storage, simulating a backend API through **JSON Server**. It includes user authentication to protect certain routes and enhance user experience.
